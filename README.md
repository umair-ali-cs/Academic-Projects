# Academic Projects

This repository contains a collection of academic and practice projects developed during my computer science studies. These projects focus on problem solving, programming fundamentals, and practical software development using C++ and Java.

## Projects

### 1. CLI Marksheet Generator (C++)
A command-line application that generates student marksheets based on entered subject data and marks. The program performs calculations such as total marks, percentages, and grade determination, demonstrating the use of structures, functions, and file handling in C++.

### 2. SIBA Transcript Generator
A transcript generation system designed to simulate the academic transcript format used at Sukkur IBA University. The project focuses on managing semester records, calculating GPA/CGPA, and presenting structured academic results.

### 3. 2D Visual Math Graph Plotter
A graphical application for plotting mathematical functions in a 2D coordinate system. The project demonstrates the implementation of coordinate scaling, function parsing, and dynamic rendering of graphs.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my academic work, strengthen programming concepts, and showcase practical implementations of algorithms, data structures, and GUI development.
